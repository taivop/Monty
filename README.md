This is a course project in MTAT.05.085 Automata, Languages and Compilers at University of Tartu.

Monty is to create a drag-and-drop programming interface for creating Python programs. Users can create programs out of simple building blocks, see the source code and execute their programs using a simple graphical interface.

To get Monty up and running, get Python 3.1.4 (32-bit), Pygame 1.9.1 for Python 3.1 and see doc/readme.txt for a short tutorial and description of the program in Estonian.
