Monty is a drag-and-drop programming interface for creating Python programs. Users can create programs out of simple building blocks, see the source code and execute their programs using a simple graphical interface.

See [Installation and Running](https://github.com/taivop/Monty/wiki/Installation-and-running) in our wiki for quick-start instructions. Read why we created Monty [here](https://github.com/taivop/Monty/wiki/Motivation).


Monty is a course project in MTAT.05.085 Automata, Languages and Compilers at University of Tartu. You can find the poster for the project [here](https://github.com/taivop/Monty/wiki/Poster).
